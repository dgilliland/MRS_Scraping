To explore word counts over time, [click here](http://ec2-54-68-119-28.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3838/).

This repository contained the following: 

(1) Python script using Beautiful Soup to download abstracts and titles on Materials Research Society's website

(2) R Script to clean data, create a word cloud, count words over time, and generate topic models

Here are some images of data exploration:
